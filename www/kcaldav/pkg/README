| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Administrator Quick Start
=========================
  Create users by running "kcaldav.passwd -C -u <user>".
  Read kcaldav.passwd(1) for more details about creating
  new calenders for users, changing email address and other
  options.

User Quick Start
================
  Users can manage their account settings, create calendars
  and find the URL for use with their calendar application
  by browsing to: http://localhost/kcaldav/home.html

Security
========
  kcaldav.cgi uses http authentication for user security.
  Install a tls certificate to ensure privacy of connection.

Porting Notes: Write Ahead Logging
==================================
  As implemented in the original source, kcaldav use sqlite3(3)
  Write Ahead Logging (WAL). WAL requires write access to /tmp.

  This port disables WAL due to the expectation kcaldav will be
  running in a chroot environment which may not have a /tmp dir.

  To re-enable WAL:

  Open the kcaldav.db:

  % doas sqlite3 caldav/kcaldav.db

  Type:

  sqlite> PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;

  To disable WAL later open the kcaldav db and type:

  sqlite> PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE;

  If you plan to run kcaldav in a chroot environment you must
  create a /tmp directory in the chroot and it must be writable
  by the httpd daemon account:

  % doas mkdir /var/www/tmp
  % doas chown www:daemon /var/www/tmp
  % doas chmod 755 /var/www/tmp

  For more details about WAL and temp directory requirements
