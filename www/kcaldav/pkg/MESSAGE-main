Install Note:
  This package installs the user-database tools. You need
  to install kcaldav-cgi to do much that's useful.

Administrator Quick Start:
  Create users by running "kcaldav.passwd -C -u <user>".
  Read kcaldav.passwd(1) for more details about creating
  new calenders for users, changing email address and other
  options.
