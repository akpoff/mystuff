Kid3 is an application to edit the ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags in MP3 files
in an efficient way. Also tags in Ogg/Vorbis, Opus, DSF, FLAC, MPC,
APE, MP4/AAC, MP2, Speex, TrueAudio, WavPack, WMA, WAV, AIFF files and
tracker modules (MOD, S3M, IT, XM) are supported. It is easy to set
tags of multiple files to the same values (e.g. album, artist, year
and genre in all files of the same album) and generate the tags from
the file name or vice versa.
