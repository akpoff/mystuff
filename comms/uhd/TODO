- Test: It builds, but does it work? Need an Ettus Research sdr or a tester.
- Fix gcc build?
  Works with clang but we get the following error with gcc:
  /usr/local/include/boost/asio/detail/impl/socket_ops.ipp:319:28: error: '::close' has not been declared result = error_wrapper(::close(s), ec);
- Tons of warnings. Should we fix these?
  - warning: format specifies type 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned long') but the argument has type 'time_t' (aka 'long long')
  - warning: rand() may return deterministic values, is that what you want?
  - warning: sprintf() is often misused, please use snprintf()
  - warning: strcat() is almost always misused, please use strlcat()
  - warning: strcpy() is almost always misused, please use strlcpy()
  - warning: wcscpy() is almost always misused, please use wcslcpy()
